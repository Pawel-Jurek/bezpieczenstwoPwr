# 🧪 Example Projects {#example-projects}

The `examples/` directory in **bezpieczenstwoPwr** contains demo applications that show how to use the core packages (like `bbotd`) in real-world scenarios.

These examples are especially useful if you're:

- New to the project and want to see it in action
- Looking for integration patterns with frontend frameworks
- Exploring different use cases (e.g., real-time detection, model evaluation)

**Available Examples** {#available-examples}

```bash
examples/
├── react-ts/ # React + TypeScript demo (hosted on GitHub Pages)
└── ... # More coming soon!
```

## React + TypeScript {#react-ts}

This is the main example that showcases how to:

- Collect user behavior data (mouse movement, input, etc.)
- Send it to the backend or process it locally
- Load a TensorFlow.js model and make predictions
- Display prediction results (normal vs. bot-like behavior)

### 🚀 Run the Example {#run-the-example}

```bash
cd examples/react-ts
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 🌐 Live Demo {#live-demo}
